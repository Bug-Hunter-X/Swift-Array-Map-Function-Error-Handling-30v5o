This repository contains a Swift code example demonstrating an error in using the map function on an array of integers, along with a solution showing proper error handling.  The original code lacks error handling, potentially causing unexpected behavior or crashes if the input array contains nil values or calculations overflow. The solution demonstrates safe handling of these situations, ensuring robustness of the code. The solution includes improved error handling using optional chaining and explicit overflow checks.
